# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Synopsis

This project includes the code necessary to convert the University of California, Irvine's (UCI) Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones data set into a tidy data set, where 'tidy' is defined as:

- Each variable measured should be contained within one column
- Each observation of that variable should be in a different row
- There should be one table for each "kind" of variable
- Multiple tables should include a column/key that allows the tables to be joined
- All variables should be: lowercase, descriptive, not duplicated, contain no underscores and contain no spaces
- All character variables should be made into factor variables
- Values should be descriptive (i.e. TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1)
- A tidy data set should only include the variables we care about
- A tidy data set should have all irrelevant and bad observations filtered out

Our tidy dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'
- 'tidyDataSet.csv': A tidy data set generated from the UCI HAR dataset
- 'CODE BOOK.md': A description of the variables found in tidyDataSet.csv
- 'INSTRUCTION LIST.md: Instructions on how to recreate tidyDataSet.csv using only this project

Information about UCI's raw data set can be found in: /data/UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt

## Methodology

## Motivation

This is the course project for John Hopkins University's Getting and Cleaning Data class, offered through Coursera.  The project will likely NOT be maintained past January 2016.
